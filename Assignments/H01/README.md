### Definitions

#### Class

> A class is a data structure that can hold public and private
>      variables, functions, methods and other objects in C++.
>![alt text](https://github.com/Landon-Brown1/2143-OOP-Brown/blob/master/Assignments/H01/Images/Class.png "Class")

#### Class Variable
> A class variable is an attribute of a class that is defined inside >      the class. (I.E. a class named Student would have class   
>      variables >such as Name, Age, Grades, etc.)

#### Object
> An object can be various things in C++, but is mainly defined as 
>      an instance of a class structure.

#### Method
> A method is a function in C++ that is used to perform actions.
>      most methods are normally part of a class and can be called
>      by an instance of that class.

#### Abstraction
> Abstraction is essentially simplifying data of output to a user in 
>      order to provide only necessary or important info to them.

#### Attributes / Properties
> Attributes, or properties, of a class or an object in C++ are 
>      simply traits of that object. For example, an attribute of 
>      a class AnimalList would be that it can hold many nodes of 
>      animals in a list structure. A property would be that it is 
>      a linked list based queue.

#### Composition
> Composition in C++ is when you combine 2 or more smaller classes to 
>      create a more complex and encompassing class, like having an 
>      Athlete class inside of a Student class; assuming they are 
>      related.

#### Encapsulation
> Encapsulation just combining functions together into a class (if I >      remember correctly). A class is by default private so the data
>      of that class is protec while the functions still have access.

#### Friends
> Friend functions are functions that are defined outside of a class 
>      but still has access to members of that class as if it were 
>      one of its own functions or methods.

#### Inheritance
> Inheritance in C++ is when you have one class or struct that 
>      inherits attrubutes or methods from another class and is able 
>      to use them as its own. An example would be an "Athlete" class 
>      inheriting methods from a "Student" class, which itself is 
>      inheriting from a "School" class.

#### Instance Variable
> Instance variables are declared inside a class and are created when >      an instance of the class is created; as well as deleted when 
>      that instance is deleted.

#### Member Variable
> A member variable is any member or object or variable that is a 
>      part of a class.
>

#### Multiple Inheritance
> Multiple inheritance is when one class inherits members and methods 
>      from multiple different parent classes
>

#### Overloading
> Overloading operators is a term in C++ where you define your own 
>      operation for a default C++ operator ([], =, <<, >>,) that 
>      performs a different function than that of the default.
>      this is done to increase versatility within programs and 
>      make things easier to use.

#### Polymorphism
> Polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a 
>      different function to be executed depending on the type of 
>      object that invokes the function.

#### Public / Private / Protected
> These are just different levels of security in a class structure. 
>      Each one provides different levels of access to that object by 
>      the user.

#### Virtual
> A virtual function a member function which is declared within a 
>      base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class
